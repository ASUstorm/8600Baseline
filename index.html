                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>For those of us who fought a proposed development several years ago, well, here we go again! For the newer folks, Nyland
                and the surrounding neighbors banned together, gave a lot of public input, and convinced the planning commission to vote
                it down in a 7-0 vote. It was a huge success for us as that developer, Reed Phillips, had an option of the property to
                build 88 units there. This is sooooo much worse. Last time around, Lafayette had a slow growth policy, issuing only a
                certain number of building permits per year. That’s no longer in place. Some highlights of my conversation with the
                planner: - 6 acres would be left “open” - 185 units is considered low-to-medium density - The “farmhouse” stays (they
                have been remodeling it) - Creating housing for people with disabilities is still part of the plan - Some low-income
                housing may also be part of the plan - The city considers us to be in a housing shortage - Nothing about horses or
                farming - The owner and developer have requested a pre-application meeting with planners, which has not yet occurred, so
                they can modify their draft to submit a better application Some thoughts on what our next steps might look like as we
                organize Nyland and the surrounding area to fight it: - Start with a special meeting here to begin organizing and form a
                task force ASAP - Connect with the surrounding neighbors (I’ve already been in touch with folks on Snow Peak) - Watch
                for postcards and signs at the property so we know when the first public meeting will take place, and show up in force
                for any and all meetings - Give as much input as possible (write letters, attend meetings, etc) during the public input
                phase - Form an off-natter email group, which I would encourage EVERYONE to join, or agree that it’s ok to use the
                natter for this purpose It’s up to ALL OF US to work together on this if we’re going to stop it or get it modified to be
                a smaller project with less impact on this section of Baseline.</p>
