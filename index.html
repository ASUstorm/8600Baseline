                <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                <p>The new owner has proposed building 186 units on this site, which is currently zoned Rural Residential in Boulder County
                and has a horse barn, pastures, main ranch house, and outbuildings. The proposal includes single-family residential and
                multi-family units with "sustainable dwelling units" that serve Intellectual and Developmental Disability and
                aging-in-place residents, as well as a few units for "affordable" housing. The City of Lafayette would have to annex the
                property and rezone it for the owner to proceed. In 2017, the planning commission unanimously rejected a proposal from a
                different developer for 86 homes on this site. </p>

                <h2>The Details</h2>
                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li><h3>Who:</h3> The current owner, Stephen J. Tzap, purchased the property in 2024. He formed Big Zapper LLC and subsequently
                    listed Aaron Burton with Burton Law Office in Denver to be his registered agent. Tzap also engaged a developer, Jack
                    Bestall of Bestall Collaborative, who has submitted a <a href="preappReview.pdf">"preapplication review"</a> document
                    with the City of Lafayette on behalf of Mr. Tzap.</li>
                    <li><h3>What:</h3> The preapplication review is the first step in a lengthy process prior to any approvals being granted or denied.
                    The owner/developer must get approval from the City of Lafayette to annex the property from Boulder County, engage in
                    multiple meetings with various City officials, meet with surrounding neighbors, and, ultimately, receive permission from
                    the City's Planning Commission and City Council before moving forward. Along the way, there are many opportunities for
                    neighbors and concerned citizens to engage in this process.</li> <li><h3>When:</h3> The exact timeline is not yet available, but <a href="https://www.lafayetteco.gov/DocumentCenter/View/40000/PROCESS-GUIDE---Annexation">the
                    process involves the steps outlined here</a></li> 
                    <li><h3>Where:</h3> The 8600 property is located near the western border of Lafayette in
                    land near Open Space from four different jurisdictions: City of Boulder, City of Louisville, City of Lafayette, and
                    Boulder County. The property is adjacent to an extended buffer zone that delineates this part of unincorporated Boulder
                    County from the adjacent municipalities of Lafayette and Louisville. There is no development of this density anywhere in
                    the immediate neighborhood.</li>
                    <li><h3>Why:</h3> We believe that this development is out of scale for the still-rural nature of this neighborhood. Development
                    planners in Boulder County and Lafayette have worked assiduously to avoid uncontrolled sprawl. This proposal leapfrogs
                    existing opportunities for connected development with accompanying city services, in keeping with the City of Lafayette
                    and Boulder County's comprehensive plans. Concerns also include escalating unsafe traffic congestion on Baseline,
                    mounting concerns about future water availability, and an overarching belief that this kind of development is expensive
                    and unwarranted at this time, in this place.
